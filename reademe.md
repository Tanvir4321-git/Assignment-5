1.  What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

answer: We can call any id from html file in Javascript by getElementById and we can call class from htm file in Javascript by getElementByClassName. So difference between getElementById and getElementByClassName is that when we use getElementById we can just call only one html element and it return only one element but when we use getElementByClassName we can call multiple html elements and it return multiple element.


querySelector and querySelectAll both are work by css selector so difference between both of them are that when  we use  querySelector it just can select only one element but querySelectAll select all element match by css selector.
